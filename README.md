Hi, my name is Max Xue.

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of New South Wales. 

I have an interest in full stack development and am currently trying to improve on my frontend web development skills.

Technologies I have experience with include:
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB (using the mongoose driver to connect to my NodeJS backend server)

Technologies I plan to learn in 2022 include: 
- Java and Java Spring Boot (with help from my object-oriented programming course in term 2)
- MySQL (with help from my databases university course in term 1)
- NextJS
- Gatsby
- Redux

I also have an interest in UX/UI design and have previously joined a university program for product design called the Product Design Program held by DigiSoc.

I have been consistently teaching myself frontend development since June 2021 and plan to really polish these skills by the end of 2022 through full stack projects using the MERN stack as well as experiment with other backend options such as Java and MySQL.
